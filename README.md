Short Summary:

  In my Random Forest model, it predicts the estimated lead time(hr.) for a sample shipment to reach it's destination by distance(km). 
  My data model trains 80% of my dataset test (20% of my sample size to measure how well model performs. 
  
  In addition, I've designed my data model to calculate custom predictions in distance(km.) or time(hr.) vice versa, (ie: 5, 10 hours etc.) against the historical data, so I can estimate future outcomes.
