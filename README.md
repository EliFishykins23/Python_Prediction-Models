Short Summary:

  In my Random Forest model, it predicts the distances for test shipment deliveries which is (20% of my dataset) to measure how good the model is. 
  Then it also predicts new distances for custom delivery times ie: (5 and 10 hours) against the historical data, so I can estimate future scenarios.
